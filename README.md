Libraries for E-LAGORi boards - Motor driver modules

The motor driver boards are used to drive rotary or a linear motor. The come under actuator catagory, They are commanded by the microcontroller to perform suitable action

Brief Description of available boards are given here.

Dual Full Bridge Motor driver board
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The module consists of 4 Half bridges which can be used to drive 4 Brushed DC motors in one direction or 2 Brushed DC motors in both directions or 1 stepper motor. The module can provide 3.6A of current per channel and current limit can be set by providing a DC voltage by either providing a voltage or through PWM pulses. Maximum voltage that can be applied to the motor is 50V. The module has optocouplers inbuilt and provides isolation to the rest of the system from motor currents. The module also provides protection against Over voltage, under voltage and reverse voltage protection.
